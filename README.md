# Ten Simple Rules for Building Open Science Community Organizations

[Matthew Turk][turk] and [Greg Wilson][wilson]

1.  **Do the reading.**
    People have been writing about their experiences with grassroots organizations for two centuries.
    Resources we have found particularly useful include *[Building Powerful Community Organizations][bpco]*
    and *[Producing Open Source Software][poss]*.

2.  **Make it a democracy.**
    Sooner or later (usually sooner),
    every appointed board turns into a mutual agreement society.
    Giving the community power is messy,
    but is the only way invented so far to ensure that
    an organization continues to meet the actual needs of the people it's supposed to be helping.

3.  **Provide training.**
    Organizations require committees, meetings, budgets, grant proposals, and dispute resolution.
    Most researchers are never taught how to do any of this,
    despite the fact that universities depend on them too.
    Training people to do these things helps your organization run more smoothly,
    and gives participants a powerful reason to get and stay involved.
    If you aren't large enough to provide training,
    join an organization that is and take some of theirs.
    As with startups,
    it's always best to learn on someone else's dime.

4.  **Communicate.**
    Nobody's going to come to a meeting unless they know about it,
    and nobody's going to help you raise money if they don't know how you're going to spend it.
    Mailing lists, blogs, and Twitter all give you ways to stay in touch.
    Use them sparingly so that your audience isn't overwhelmed,
    but use them.
    *[Marketing for Scientists][kuchner]* is a good place to start for guidance.

5.  **Write down the rules.**
    As Jo Freeman described in "[The Tyranny of Structurelessness][structurelessness]",
    every organization has a power structure:
    the only question is whether it's formal and accountable,
    or informal and unaccountable.
    Make yours one of the first kind:
    write and publish the rules governing everything from
    who gets to decide when software is ready to release
    and who's allowed to use the name and logo
    to how complaints of inappropriate conduct are handled
    and what actually constitutes inappropriate conduct.
    (This [model anti-harassment policy][coc] is a good start.)

6.  **Make space for everyone.**
    If you're too engaged or too quick on the reply button,
    people have less opportunity to grow as members
    and to create horizontal collaborations.
    The community can continue to be "hub and spoke",
    focused around one or two individuals,
    rather than a highly-connected network
    in which others feel comfortable participating.

6.  **FIXME**

10. **Move on.**
    Every organization eventually needs fresh ideas and fresh leadership.
    When that time comes,
    train your successors and then move on.
    They will undoubtedly do things you wouldn't have,
    but the same is true of every generation.
    Few things in life are as satisfying as
    watching something you helped build take on a life of its own.
    Celebrate that---you won't have any trouble finding
    something else to keep you busy.
